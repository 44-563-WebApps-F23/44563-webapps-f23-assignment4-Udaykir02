        So I imagined. I hear my brother has become a prolific
        contributor to the "People's Messenger."
    </p>

    <h4 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h4>
    <p class="speech">
        Yes, he is good enough to write in the "People's Messenger"
        when he has any home truths to tell.

        readiest sympathy. And, besides that, I personally have no reason to
        bear any ill will to your paper, Mr. Hovstad.
