        <p class="direction">[coming forward into the sitting-room]</p>
        Ah, good
        evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!
    </p>

    <p class="Peter speech">
        I happened to be passing, and so—
        <p class="direction">[looks into the
        dining-room].</p>
        But you have company with you, I see.

    <p class="Stockmann">
        <p class="direction">[a little embarrassed]</p>. 
        Oh, no—it was quite by chance
        he came in. 
        <p class="direction">[Hurriedly.]</p>
         Won't you come in and have something, too?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class="Peter">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Peter speech">
        I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
        Not with my digestion.
    </p>

    <h5 class= "Mrs.Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Stockmann">
        Oh, but just once in a way—
    </p>  
    <br>
    <h5 class= "Mrs.Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Stockmann">
        No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.

        <p class="direction">[smiling]</p>. Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.

    <h5 class="Peter">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Stockmann">
        Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
        <p class="direction">[Points to the Doctor's study.] Is he not at home?
    </p>
    <br>
    <h5 class= "Mrs.Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Stockmann">
        No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
        the boys.

    <h5 class="Peter">Peter Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Peter speech">
        I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. <p class="direction">[Listens.]</p> I
        fancy I hear him coming now.

    <h5 class= "Mrs.Stockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h5>
    <p class="Stockmann">
        No, I don't think it is he. <p class="direction">[A knock is heard at the
        door.] Come in! <p class="direction">[HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.]</p> Oh, it is you, Mr.
        Hovstad!

    <h5 class="Hovstad">Hovstad.</h5>
    <p class="Hovstad speech">
        Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
        printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.

        <p class="direction">[bowing a little distantly]</p>.
        Good evening. You have
        come on business, no doubt.
