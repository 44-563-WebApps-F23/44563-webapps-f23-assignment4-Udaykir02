    <h1>Uday acts in a play.</h1>
    <h2>Play: An Enemy of the People.</h2>
    <p>Author: Ibsen</p>

    <p>Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
        evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
        dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance
        he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
        Not with my digestion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—
    </p>  
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
        (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
        the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
        fancy I hear him coming now.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mrs. Stockmann. No, I don't think it is he. (A knock is heard at the
        door.) Come in! (HOVSTAD comes in from the hall.) Oh, it is you, Mr.
        Hovstad!

    </p>
    <p>
        Hovstad. Yes, I hope you will forgive me, but I was delayed at the
        printers. Good evening, Mr. Mayor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Peter Stockmann (bowing a little distantly). Good evening. You have
        come on business, no doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hovstad. Partly. It's about an article for the paper.
