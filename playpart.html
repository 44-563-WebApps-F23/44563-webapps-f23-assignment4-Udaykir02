    <h1>Uday acts in a play.</h1>
    <h2>Play: An Enemy of the People.</h2>
    <p>Author: Ibsen</p>

    <p>Mrs. Stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). Ah, good
        evening—is it you? How good of you to come up and see us!
        
        Peter Stockmann. I happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the
        dining-room). But you have company with you, I see.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (a little embarrassed). Oh, no—it was quite by chance
        he came in. (Hurriedly.) Won't you come in and have something, too?
        
        Peter Stockmann. I! No, thank you. Good gracious—hot meat at night!
        Not with my digestion.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, but just once in a way—
        
        Peter Stockmann. No, no, my dear lady; I stick to my tea and bread and
        butter. It is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more
        economical, too.
        
        Mrs. Stockmann (smiling). Now you mustn't think that Thomas and I are
        spendthrifts.
        
        Peter Stockmann. Not you, my dear; I would never think that of you.
        (Points to the Doctor's study.) Is he not at home?
        
        Mrs. Stockmann. No, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and
        the boys.
        
        Peter Stockmann. I doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (Listens.) I
        fancy I hear him coming now.
